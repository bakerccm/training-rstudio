# conda-workshop binder

[![Binder](https://binder.pangeo.io/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/bakerccm/training-rstudio/conda-workshop?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository holds binder files to create an Rstudio binder that can be used for conda training.

These files are used in hands-on workshop activities:
- `workshop_commands.sh` for conda commands
- `test.yml` for specifying an environment with YAML file
